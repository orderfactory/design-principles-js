# Design Principles in JavaScript

This project demonstrates various programming design principles in JavaScript. Each principle is organized in its own folder with two JavaScript files:

1. A file demonstrating the correct implementation of the principle
2. A file demonstrating a violation of the principle

## Principles Implemented

### 1. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Location:** [liskov-substitution-principle](./liskov-substitution-principle)

**Files:**
- [correct-implementation.js](./liskov-substitution-principle/correct-implementation.js) - Shows a proper implementation of LSP using Shape, Rectangle, and Square classes
- [violation.js](./liskov-substitution-principle/violation.js) - Demonstrates a common LSP violation by making Square a subclass of Rectangle

**Key Concept:**
The LSP is violated when a subclass doesn't properly fulfill the contract of its parent class. In the violation example, a Square is implemented as a subclass of Rectangle, but because a square has the constraint that all sides must be equal (which a rectangle doesn't have), it cannot be substituted for a Rectangle in all cases without breaking the program's correctness.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Location:** [open-closed-principle](./open-closed-principle)

**Files:**
- [correct-implementation.js](./open-closed-principle/correct-implementation.js) - Shows a proper implementation of OCP using a discount calculator system with strategy pattern
- [violation.js](./open-closed-principle/violation.js) - Demonstrates a violation of OCP with a discount calculator that requires modification to add new customer types

**Key Concept:**
The OCP is violated when adding new functionality requires modifying existing code. In the violation example, adding a new customer type requires modifying the DiscountCalculator class. The correct implementation uses the strategy pattern to allow adding new customer types without modifying existing code.

### 3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

**Location:** [dependency-inversion-principle](./dependency-inversion-principle)

**Files:**
- [correct-implementation.js](./dependency-inversion-principle/correct-implementation.js) - Shows a proper implementation of DIP using a notification system with dependency injection
- [violation.js](./dependency-inversion-principle/violation.js) - Demonstrates a violation of DIP with a notification service that directly depends on concrete implementations

**Key Concept:**
The DIP is violated when high-level modules directly depend on low-level modules instead of abstractions. In the violation example, the NotificationService directly instantiates and uses concrete implementations, creating tight coupling. The correct implementation uses dependency injection and abstractions to decouple the high-level module from the specific implementations.
